Actual Task:

1.	Fruit Machine
You are to produce an application which simulates a fruit machine. When the application starts, the user is asked to enter their name. The application is to then generate three random numbers between 1 and 6.  These three numbers are to be displayed in a row. The score is then determined as follows:

•	All three numbers the same, the user gains 2 points
•	Two numbers the same, the user gains 1 point.
•	Each number is different, the computer gains 1 point.

The score is then displayed and the user is asked if play should continue, if they answer “yes” the random numbers are then generated again, the three numbers are then displayed and the score updated and displayed. 

This process is then repeated until the user chooses to stop play.

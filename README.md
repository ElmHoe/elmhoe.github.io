Actual Task:

3.	Pizza shop ordering system
You will produce a system that allows a customer to place an order for pizza; the final cost of the order will be displayed at the end of the procedure.

The system will ask the user to input their name, and select a pizza base from the following options, select an appropriate cost for each:

•	Stuffed crust
•	Thin and crispy
•	Deep pan

It will then ask for the toppings from a list you are welcome to choose, select an appropriate cost for each.
It will then ask for any side orders / drinks from a list you are welcome to choose, select an appropriate cost for each.
A total for that pizza will be calculated 
The user will be asked if they wish to add another pizza to their order and the process is repeated until they decline.

It will then ask for the user to input how many miles from the pizza shop they are, the system will decide the delivery cost based on the following formula:

•	0-2 miles: free
•	2-4 miles: £2.50
•	5-7 miles: £5.00
•	Above 7 miles: no delivery available

This order total will be displayed with any other information you deem pertinent
